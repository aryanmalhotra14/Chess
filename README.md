# Final Project - Chess Game

All the images of pieces are rendered by us.  
Instead of using a predefined API, we have made all the logic behind the pieces using JavaScript.  

> How to run the code:
- Naviagate to the folder containing directories 'Server' and 'Client' using 'cd'
- Run the command : node Server\server.js
- After running the command go to new chrome tab and enter http://localhost:8000/
